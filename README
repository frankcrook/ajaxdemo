This is a small AJAX demo. It runs on a node.js server. (http://nodejs.org)
Tested on node v0.6.9, but there's very little going on here, so it will probably run on earlier versions.

Type this command in the terminal of a computer with node installed, while in the src directory:
> node index.js

Then visit localhost:8000 in a browser.

Recently fixed:
- No longer hangs after several submissions (was caused by not sending proper response to browser in request.js/submit)
- Stopped using filesystem, code was leftover from the start of the project when this was a bit more ambitious in scope
- longPoll responds based on emitters now
- On a timeout, server is polled appropriately and longPoll restarts

Current Bugs:
- Behaves oddly with multiple copies of the same browser -- one tab or window receives a response at a time. Not an issue with two different browser programs though (such as a Firefox and Chrome window). Carries across incognito tabs as well. :I
