This is a small AJAX demo. It runs on a node.js server. (http://nodejs.org)
Tested on node v0.6.9, but there's very little going on here, so it will probably run on earlier versions.

Type this command in the terminal of a computer with node installed, while in the src directory:
> node index.js

Then visit localhost:8000 in a browser.

Bugs:
* Rapidly submitting can cause your browser to hang and stop responding until a refresh. I'm looking into it.
