    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>This is a simple demo of long polling. When you (or any other user
      on this website) submit the form  above, the server generates a
      SHA1 hash using the post data, then sends that hash to anyone
      viewing the site.</p>
    <p>Try this in two different tabs at the same time, or on two
      computers, to get a better perspective of what's going on.</p>
    <h3>Why hashes?</h3>
    <p>Because I don't want to read what anyone has to say in an
      anonymous chat room on the Internet.</p>
    <p>Actually, it's to keep this from becoming too complicated. It's
      intended to be a straightforward demo of how long polling
      works. If you want raw text, you'll also want logic for:
      <ul>
        <li>Formatting strings from POST data</li>
        <li>Escaping user input</li>
        <li>Identifying abuse of the service</li>
      </ul>
      And from there, we start to get feature creep, such as giving
      names to users. This is just a simple demo for someone to inspect
      to see how long polling can work -- not what it can do.
    <h3>Source?</h3>
    <p>You can find the source on
      <a href="https://github.com/frankcrook/ajaxdemo">Github</a>. The
      server is written with node.js, the AJAX is jQuery. </p>
